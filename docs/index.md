The PARC Engineers league tasks participants to reimagine how humans can augment the capabilities of intelligent robots in a task of growing prevalence - autonomous parcel delivery.

The challenge of the competition is to build software to operate a wheeled mobile robot to complete a delivery task including: navigating through a sidewalk, crossing the road using a crosswalk and navigating in a park to find the drop location.
